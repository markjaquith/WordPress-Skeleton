<?php echo S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_REGISTRATION_DAYS; ?>
This may output something like: 120 (120 days is approx 4 months)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the longer they've been registered (for free or otherwise), the more they get.

<?php if(S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_REGISTRATION_DAYS >= 30){ ?>
	Drip content to Users who've been registered for at least 30 days.
<?php } ?>

<?php if(S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_REGISTRATION_DAYS >= 60){ ?>
	Drip content to Users who've been registered for at least 60 days.
<?php } ?>

<?php if(S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_REGISTRATION_DAYS >= 90){ ?>
	Drip content to Users who've been registered for at least 90 days.
<?php } ?>

---- s2member Shortcode Equivalent (Requires s2Member Pro) ----

[s2If php="S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_REGISTRATION_DAYS >= 60"]

**NOTE** The use of `[s2If php=""]` requires s2Member Pro.
**NOTE** Arbitrary PHP code (via [s2If php=""]) will only work if you enable this functionality.
	Please visit `Dashboard → s2Member → Restriction Options → Simple Shortcode Conditionals`
		to set your preferences and enable `[s2If php=""]` when s2Member Pro is installed.
