     *     - id string the Order Id
     *     - campaign_id string optional the Campaign Id to track this order against (see the "mc_cid" query string variable a campaign passes)
     *     - email_id string optional (kind of) the Email Id of the subscriber we should attach this order to (see the "mc_eid" query string variable a campaign passes) - required if campaign_id is passed, otherwise either this or <strong>email</strong> is required. If both are provided, email_id takes precedence
     *     - email string optional (kind of) the Email Address we should attach this order to - either this or <strong>email_id</strong> is required. If both are provided, email_id takes precedence
     *     - total double The Order Total (ie, the full amount the customer ends up paying)
     *     - order_date string optional the date of the order - if this is not provided, we will default the date to now. Should be in the format of 2012-12-30
     *     - shipping double optional the total paid for Shipping Fees
     *     - tax double optional the total tax paid
     *     - store_id string a unique id for the store sending the order in (32 bytes max)
     *     - store_name string optional a "nice" name for the store - typically the base web address (ie, "store.mailchimp.com"). We will automatically update this if it changes (based on store_id)
     *     - items array structs for each individual line item including:
     *         - line_num int optional the line number of the item on the order. We will generate these if they are not passed
     *         - product_id int the store's internal Id for the product. Lines that do no contain this will be skipped
     *         - sku string optional the store's internal SKU for the product. (max 30 bytes)
     *         - product_name string the product name for the product_id associated with this item. We will auto update these as they change (based on product_id)
     *         - category_id int (required) the store's internal Id for the (main) category associated with this product. Our testing has found this to be a "best guess" scenario
     *         - category_name string (required) the category name for the category_id this product is in. Our testing has found this to be a "best guess" scenario. Our plugins walk the category heirarchy up and send "Root - SubCat1 - SubCat4", etc.
     *         - qty double optional the quantity of the item ordered - defaults to 1
     *         - cost double optional the cost of a single item (ie, not the extended cost of the line) - defaults to 0

     *     - complete bool whether the call worked. reallistically this will always be true as errors will be thrown otherwise.
