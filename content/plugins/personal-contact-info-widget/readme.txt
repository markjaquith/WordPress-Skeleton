* Upload a profile photo, or choose one from your existing Media Library
* 4 different photo styles to choose from (newer internet browsers)
* Enter contact information (full name, slogan, email, phone number, alternate website address)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `personal-contact-info-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the Personal Contact Info Widget plugin through the 'plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin by going to `Appearance > Widgets` in the WordPress Admin Dashboard, drag the Personal Contact Info Widget to a Sidebar or Widget area, and start filling out the details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed and activated your plugin Widget, but how do I configure it? =

To configure the new Widget (Personal Contact Info), go to `Appearance > Widgets` in the WordPress Admin Dashboard, drag the Widget to a Sidebar or Widget area on the right, and start filling out the details.

= I changed the profile image style, but only square and thumbnail work on my website?  =

The Image Style feature is based on CSS3, which is only available on newer internet browsers. Most users will see the styles, however older computers with outdated browsers may not see the image styles (will default to square). 
= What is Font Awesome, and do I want to load it? =

This plugin utilizes special fonts (Font Awesome) in order to display the various icons on your website. In order to see these icons, Font Awesome has to be loaded first. The problem is that some themes and plugins may already be loading it on your website. 

To avoid Font Awesome from loading more than once on your website, I have made this an opt-out feature. If you are not sure if your current theme or plugins are already loading Font Awesome, just check the "Do not load Font Awesome" box in the Advanced Options section  (in the configuration options for your Widget in the WordPress Admin Dashboard under Appearance > Widgets). If your Social Media icons disappear on your website, simply go back and uncheck this option and save the changes again.
