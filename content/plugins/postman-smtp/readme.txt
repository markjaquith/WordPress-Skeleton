Send, log and troubleshoot your Outgoing Email easily. Supports everything: SMTP, Gmail, Mandril, SendGrid and OAuth 2.0!

== Description ==

Postman is a next-generation [SMTP Mailer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=smtp), software that assists in the delivery of email generated by your WordPress site. Postman is the first and only plugin to support the [latest security standards](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/04/new-security-measures-will-affect-older.html). With OAuth 2.0, there is **no need** to [store your email passsword](http://blog.codinghorror.com/youre-probably-storing-passwords-incorrectly/) in the WordPress database where it might be found.

> Big release! With v1.7 send email over HTTPS with the Mandrill and SendGrid APIs, resend emails right from the Email Log, Import configuration and more!

The **Connectivity Test** and intelligent **Setup Wizard** scan your SMTP server to detect firewall blocks and eliminate configuration mistakes. The built-in **Email Log** is an invaluable resource for [diagnosing problems](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/ugly-e-mails-no-html-and-no-special-characters?replies=15) with emails. Even hosts that block the standard SMTP ports, like GoDaddy or Bluehost, can't stop your email as **Postman can deliver via HTTPS** if it can't use SMTP.

Postman is *not* another WP Mail SMTP clone like WP Bank or Easy SMTP. It replaces the default WordPress SMTP library, PHPMailer, with the heavy-duty Zend_Mail. Never [lose an email to PHP mail()](http://www.jvfconsulting.com/blog/php-mail-function-vs-smtp-guaranteed-delivery/) again.

= Standard Features =
* Easy-to-use, powerful Setup Wizard for perfect configuration
* Commercial-grade Connectivity Tester to diagnose server issues
* Log and resend all emails; see the exact cause of failed emails
* Supports [International alphabets](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6530), [HTML Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_email) and [MultiPart/Alternative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME#Alternative)
* Supports forced recipients (cc, bcc, to) and custom email headers
* [SASL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer) Support: Plain/Login/CRAM-MD5/[XOAUTH2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0) authentication
* Security Support: [SMTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTPS) and [STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS) ([SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security))
* Copy configuration to other instances of Postman

= OAuth 2.0 Features =
* Supports the proprietary OAuth 2.0 implementations of Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo
* Fire-and-forget delivery continues even if your password changes

== Installation ==

> To send email reliably, you must use the SMTP server assigned to that email. If Postman is unable to connect to the right SMTP server, you may have to ask your host to open the ports, or create a new email account managed by your host, or switch hosts!
> 
> The Connectivity Test utility will tell you which ports are open and the actions available to you.

= Easy install and setup! (Recommended for all users) =
1. Install and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. In the WordPress 'Settings' menu select 'Postman SMTP'.

> Postman is developed on OS X with PHP 5.5.14 and Apache 2.4.9. Postman is tested in a [Red Hat OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com/) environment with PHP 5.3.3 and Apache 2.2.15 with Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail (US). Postman is tested with [mailtrap.io](http://mailtrap.io).



== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= What is OAuth 2.0? =

A modern replacement for traditional password-based authentication. Postman supports the OAuth 2.0 implementations of all three major e-mail providers: Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo Mail.

= How does OAuth 2.0 work? =

Postman requests a limited access OAuth 2.0 token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) and perform a specific service (handle Gmail, stay out of Google Docs) with no need for you to surrender your username and password credentials (master house key).

Once access is granted, Postman commandeers the WordPress wp_mail() function to provide an incredibly stable mail sub-system.

= Can't I just tell Google to allow less secure apps and keep using my old password? =

Google does have a setting to [allow less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) but this option is [not available](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/postman-smtp/assets/Screen%20Shot%202015-02-21%20at%208.52.13%20PM.png) if you're using *Google Apps* to manage a domain.

There are many reasons why OAuth 2.0 is better than any password-based mechanism:

* Postman will never ask for your password, so your password can't be stolen
* If you change your password regularly, you will never have to update Postman's configuration
* You have tighter control over the data Postman has access to. For Google users it can never access your Calendar or Docs or YouTube; for Yahoo users it can never access your Flickr
* If your WordPress site gets hacked, you can revoke Postman's email access without impacting any other application or website that has access to your account

> **[NEVER give out your Gmail, Microsoft or Yahoo password](http://blog.varonis.com/giving-away-your-passwords/)** to a 3rd-party or 3rd-party program that you don't fully trust.

= What is a Client ID? =
To use OAuth, your website needs it's own Client ID. The Client ID is used to control authentication and authorization and is tied to the specific URL of your website. If you manage several websites, you will need a different Client ID for each one.

= How do I get a Google Client ID? (For Gmail users only!) =

https://vimeo.com/128589255

== Grant OAuth permission error messages ==

Please note that the Client ID and Client Secret fields are NOT for your username and password. They are for OAuth Credentials only.

= Error authenticating with this Client ID. [Error executing wp_remote_post: The user has blocked requests via HTTP.] =

Your WordPress site is configured with WP_HTTP_BLOCK_EXTERNAL to prevent outbound connections. Add a whitelist rule to wp-config.php:
> define('WP_ACCESSIBLE_HOSTS', 'www.googleapis.com, login.live.com, api.login.yahoo.com');

= Error authenticating with this Client ID. [Error executing wp_remote_post: Failed to connect to xxxx] =

There is a firewall on port 443 between you and the OAuth2 server. Open up the port for outbound connections.

= Error: redirect_uri_mismatch =

* You did not enter the Redirect URI correctly, watch the [instructional video](https://vimeo.com/128589255)
* You used an IP address instead of a domain name (not allowed)

= Error: invalid_client ... no support email =

You've [forgotten to choose an email address in the consent screen](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/status-postman-is-not-sending-mail-1?replies=7).


== SMTP Error Messages ==

= Communication Error [334] – make sure the Envelope From Email is the same account used to create the Client ID. =

* This is almost always caused by being logged in to Google/Microsoft/Yahoo with a different user than the one Postman is configured to send mail with. Logout and try again with the correct user
* Login to [Webmail](http://www.gmail.com) and see if there is an "Unusual Activity" warning waiting for your attention

= Could not open socket =

* Your host may have installed a firewall between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use SSL over port 587. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Operation Timed out =

* Your host may have poor connectivity to the mail server. Try doubling the Read Timeout.
* Your host may have installed a firewall (DROP packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use TLS over port 465. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Connection refused =

Your host has likely installed a firewall (REJECT packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.

= 503 Bad sequence of commands =

You configured TLS security when you should have selected no security.

= XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism not supported =

You may be on a Virtual Private Server that is [playing havoc with your communications](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/oh-bother-xoauth2-authentication-mechanism-not-supported?replies=9). Jump ship.


== Mail ends up in the Spam folder ==

To avoid being flagged as spam, you need to prove your email isn't forged. On a custom domain, its up to YOU to set that up:

* Ensure you are using the correct SMTP server with authentication - the correct SMTP server is the one defined by your email service's SPF record
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add an [SPF record](http://www.openspf.org/Introduction) to your DNS zone file. The SPF is specific to your email provider, for example [Google](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33786)
* If you use a custom domain name for email, add a DKIM record to your DNS zone file and upload your Domain Key (a digital signature) to, for example [Google]((https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?hl=en))

= 1.5.11 - 2015-04-05 =

* Commercial-grade improvements to Connectivity Test and Setup Wizard. The new wizard prevents misconfiguration by interrogating the MTA for capabilities and intelligently suggests the best settings for the user. Steve Jobs would be proud.

* Fixed Wizard's MSA hostname guess for Outlook 365 addresses (smtp.live.com is for their free Hotmail service)
* Added French/Italian translation for JQuery Validation

= 1.5.10 - 2015-03-29 =
* Fix for Fatal error: Cannot redeclare class PEAR_Common in C:\PHP5\PEAR\PEAR\Common.php - similar to [this error](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-minify-cant-activate-plugin-fatal-error?replies=6) in WP Minify

* Removed display_errors=On, Mr. Space Cadet here left it in the previous release by accident

= 1.5.1 - 2015-02-23 =
* Bugs slipped through. In the Wizard, choosing port 465 was not hiding the authentication label. Worse, choosing port 587 was not showing the authentication buttons.
* In the wizard, if no ports are available for use, the error message was not being displayed.

= 1.5 - 2015-02-22 =
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/oh-bother-connection-refused?replies=12)|[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/impossible-to-send-mail?replies=6)] Added support for modular transports. The first external transport is the Postman Gmail Extension, which uses the Gmail API to send mail out on the HTTPS port, a convenient way around traditional TCP port blocks for Gmail users
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-error-on-plugin-activation?replies=33)] Made my debug logging "less agressive" so that broken systems (those that pipe warning messages to STDOUT regardless of the WordPress WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY setting or PHP's display_errors settings) will no longer experience the Port Test hanging during a check
* Fixed a bug in the Setup Wizard where it would not use OAuth 2.0 on port 587
* Fixed a bug where Postman refused to send mail with Password authentication and no encryption (who does that??)

= 1.4.1 - 2015-02-17 =
* All text has been [externalized](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/postman-smtp/trunk/Postman/languages/postman-smtp.pot) in prep for [I18N Internationalization and localization](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers)

* Added more error checking, and more warning messages.
* Translated into French, thank-you Etienne Provost

= 1.4 - 2015-02-15 =

* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-error-on-plugin-activation?replies=33)] Suppressed warning messages generated by calls to fsockopen - they were causing the remote Ajax queries to hang
* The wizard was resetting some settings by accident, namely Connection Timeout, Read Timeout and Reply-To
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-error-on-plugin-activation?replies=33)] Found an environment where calls to error_log were being displayed in the HTML even after display_errors was disabled. Therefore, disabled error_log calls by default. The log may be re-enabled in Advanced Settings
* The Bad, Postman! screen was messing with the Port Test Ajax call when fsockopen generated an error and debug level is set to E_ALL in php.ini. Therefore added a switch in the configuration "Show Error Screen" that is off by default. When it is off, Port Test works perfect but errors generate a WSOD. When it is on, errors are displayed in the "Bad, Postman!" screen but Port Test fails.
* I heard that some hosts, like WPEngine, do not allow writing to the Http Session. Well that's balls. I've modified the code to write to the database instead.

= 1.3.4 - 2015-02-11 =
* 500 downloads and six 5-star ratings in only three weeks! Cool! 8-)
* Replaced the Google OAuth API with pure PHP code. No more unexpected Google API errors.
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/contact-7-and-activation-error?replies=16)] Enabled overriding of the timeouts in the configuration screen. If Postman is intermittently sending mail, doubling the TCP Read Timeout may help
* Added the SMTP session transcript output when a test message fails to send.
* Fixed the error: Class 'Zend_Mail_Protocol_Smtp_Auth_Plain' not found in /Postman/Postman-Mail/Zend-1.12.10/Mail/Transport/Smtp.php on line 198
* Passwords in the database are now Base64-encoded so casual viewing of the database won't reveal them
* Fixed a couple minor database upgrade bugs: for new users who use Password Authentication, and for old users that don't have an expiry token stored
* Added a version shortcode, mostly for promotion of Postman on my own websites
* Serveal minor tweaks to the user interface, including focus, style, validation, and enabling/disabling inputs where applicable

= 1.3.2 - 2015-02-10 =
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/contact-7-and-activation-error?replies=16)] Fixed the error: PHP Fatal error:  Call to private PostmanAuthorizationToken::__construct() This occurs when upgrading from a pre-v1.0 version of Postman (when PostmanAuthorizationToken had a public constructor) to v1.0 or higher
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/404-not-found-79?replies=17)] Fixed the error PHP Fatal error: Class 'Google_IO_Stream' not found in /Postman/Postman-Auth/google-api-php-client-1.1.2/src/Google/Client.php on line 600 by including Google/IO/Stream.php
* Postman now has a modest fatal error screen, rather than a dreaded white screen of death

= 1.3 - 2015-02-09 =

* Added Ajax to manual config and wizard screens to allow dynamic OAuth2 redirect url + help text changes in response to hostname changes
* Removed 'Allow Plugin to Override Sender' user input
* Added Online Support link in menu
* Clarified text in 'Run a Port Test' so people won't continue to ask me about connection problems (hopefully)

= 1.2 - 2015-02-04 =
* Support for Sender Name and Reply-To. Turns out Google no longer honours the MUA Return-Path header due to Spam. Makes sense, so I've decided not to add a Return-Path field to Postman's configuration.
* Support for WordPress filters [wp_mail_from](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_mail_from) and [wp_mail_from_name](http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/wp_mail_from_name)
* Disable stats-keeping for email sent by the test function
* Minor tweaks to the Wizard to support WordPress v3.9

* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/contact-form-7-not-sending-after-update-of-postman-smtp?replies=5)] Fixed a bug I introduced in 1.1. Thanks to user derrey for catching this one.

* Overhaul of the UI - A navigation pane is shown at the top of each page and each major function has been separated into its own screen
* Postman now supports sending with basic auth and no auth just like the other SMTP plugins
* Added a Port Test function so users can have peace of mind whether the plugin is failing (never!) or whether the host has firewalled them 
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/emails-not-sending-in-html-format?replies=5)] Now supports email headers, such as a text/html content-type
* Now supports email attachments
* Added a warning if the user has configured OAuth but not requested permission from Google

* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/parse-error-syntax-error-unexpected-t_string-63?replies=24)] Fixed "Warning: Missing argument 2 for update_option()". Thanks to user kaorw for catching ths one. Fixed by calling delete_option instead of update_option().
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/call-to-undefined-function-str_getcsv?replies=12)] Fixed "Fatal error: Call to undefined function str_getcsv()". Thanks to user micb for catching ths one. This function is not available before PHP 5.3. Fixed by replacing str_getdsv() with custom implementation.

= 0.2.5 - 2015-01-27 =
* [[Ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/parse-error-syntax-error-unexpected-t_string-63?replies=24)] Removed the namespace for users with older version of PHP
* Changed the Postman Redirect URI (now includes a trailing ?page=postman) - this means Client ID's from 0.2.4 or earlier MUST be updated with the new Redirect URI or re-created from scratch.

= 0.2.4 - 2015-01-25 =
* Fixed issues on servers where the plugin is installed as a symbolic link.

* Added 'Delete All Data' button to erase the stored tokens
* OpenShift production problem: This environment didn't like the callback and there were possibly invalid characters in the source script

= 0.1 - 2015-01-19 =
* First release. Happy Fig Newton Day! It was a grueling week-end, studying PHP and OAuth and Googling like a Boss, but it's done and it works!
