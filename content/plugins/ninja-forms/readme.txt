Create forms and manage submissions easily with a simple drag and drop interface. Contact forms, subscription forms, or any other form for WordPress.

== Description ==
Ninja Forms is the easiest way to build any form you need for your WordPress website. No longer mess with code or worry about made-up limitations. Create the form you want, when you want with a simple drag and drop interface provided by the very powerful Ninja Forms framework.

**Features of Ninja Forms include, but are not limited to:**

* Over a dozen types of fields you can add to your form.
* Absolutely no limitations to the number of forms, fields, emails, actions, or submissions.
* Custom input masks allow you to restrict user input in your forms for things like phone numbers, currency, and dates.
* Manage, Edit, and Export form user submissions.
* Save fields as favorites and re-use them in multiple forms.
* Export and Import forms and favorite fields.
* Set required fields.
* Add a datepicker to text fields.
* Email form results to any number of pre-determined email addresses, as well as specific messages to the user filling out the form.
* Customize form emails with the WordPress editor.
* 4 Anti-Spam options.
* Extremely developer friendly.
* Submit your form by reloading the page or asynchronously with AJAX.
* Please note that if you are using a version of PHP lower than 5.3, you may experience some problems using AJAX Submissions. These can be minimized by using simple success/error messages without any quotes or special characters.

= Ninja Forms also has a complete library of add-ons to take your forms to new heights: =

**Increase form conversions**

[Breaking forms into smaller parts](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/mult-part-forms/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Multi-Part+Forms) or [allowing users to save and return](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/save-progress/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Save+Progress) make longer forms less intimidating. [Conditional Logic](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/conditional-logic/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Conditional+Logic) will allow you to show field only to users who need them and send emails or process actions only under specific conditions.

Beautiful forms convert better than crowded unorganized forms. While Ninja Forms looks great on any well styled theme and is easy to style further if your are comforatble with CSS, [Layout and Styles](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/layout-styles/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Layout+and+Styles) makes it easy to create columns for your forms as well as style specific elements.

**Build your mailing lists with ease**

Use the mailing list tool of your choice. [MailChimp](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/mail-chimp/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=MailChimp), [Constant Contact](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/constant-contact/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Constant+Contact), [Campaign Monitor](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/campaign-monitor/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Campaign+Monitor), [Emma](hhttps://ninjaforms.com/extensions/emma/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Emma), [Aweber](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/aweber/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Aweber), [MailPoet](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/mailpoet/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=MailPoet), [iContact](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/icontact/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=iContact), [GetResponse](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/getresponse/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=GetResponse), [CleverReach](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/cleverreach/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=CleverReach), [Sendy](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/sendy/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Sendy), and [Mad Mimi](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/mad-mimi/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Mad+Mimi) are all supported for your list building needs.

**Easily collect payments**

Ninja Forms gives you the ability to collect payments through [PayPal Express](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/paypal-express/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=PayPal+Express), [Stripe](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/stripe/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Stripe), or [Elavon](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/elavon/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Elavon). More payment gateways coming.

**All the best customer relationship management integrations**

When someone fills out your form the most natural thing to do is send their data directly to your favorite CRM. Ninja Forms makes this easy with plenty of CRM integrations such as [SalesForce](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/salesforce-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=SalesForce+CRM), [Batchbook](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/batchbook-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Batchbook+CRM), [Zoho](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/zoho-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Zoho+CRM), [Insightly](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/insightly-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Insightly+CRM), [Capsule](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/capsule-crm/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Capsule+CRM), etc.

We love and use tools like [Slack](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/slack/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Slack), [Trello](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/trello/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Trello), and [Zapier](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/zapier/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_campaign=Ninja+Forms+Readme&utm_content=Zapier). These tools help our very own team build Ninja Forms so it makes sense that we would share them with you.

= 2.0.5 =

* Added a label in the plugin settings “Label” tab for an invalid email address.
* Added Shortcode and Template Function output to the Form List. You can now copy and paste the shortcode from there.

= 2.0.4 =

*Features:*

* Added a label field to the plugin settings page that will allow users to set the message displayed above the form when there is a required field error.
* Setting a text or textarea’s label position to ‘inside’ will now cause the label to be auto-removed when the input receives focus. If a user leaves the field blank, the label will return.

*Changes:*

* Increased the max file size for form imports.
* Added a filter: ninja_forms_field_wrap_class. This filter is sent a string that contains the wrap class for each field along with its field id.
* The CSS class of the list field wrapping div has been modified slightly. It has been changed from .list to .list-dropdown where dropdown is the list type.
* Added a new shortcode for inserting the date into the success message and emails: [ninja_forms_sub_date format="m/d/Y"]. It follows the php.net date() string formats and defaults to m/d/Y.

*Bugs:*

* Fixed a bug that prevented Help Text from displayin properly when the label was set to the “inside” position.

* Changed the [label] system to [ninja_forms_field id=3] where 3 is the field ID that you want to insert.

*Changes:*

*Changed the way that "settings saved" messages appear. When creating a save function on the admin-backend, you can now return the update message you wish users to see.

*Bugs:*

* Fixed a bug that prevented list-based checkboxes from showing up properly when editing submissions.
* Fixed a bug that was causing required checkboxes not to validate properly.
